Welcome! I'm not sure why you're here, but if you want to read about things I find interesting, then stick around!

I'm an Application Engineer at [Blue Stingray](https://www.bluestingray.com), a software company in St. Louis, MO.
I've been working on [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com) projects for about 3 years at this point, which is written in [Python](https://www.python.org) and XML.
I've used [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) most of my career, but I switched to [Neovim](https://neovim.io) full time earlier this year and I'm not looking back.

As far as this blog goes, I'll be writing about whatever interesting things I find - mostly relating to [Python](https://www.python.org), [Vim](https://www.vim.org)/[Neovim](https://neovim.io), and [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com). Maybe I'll even sprinkle in something interesting - we'll see!
